Repository created for the optional programming exercise. The assigned algorithm is Greedy Routing Algorithm on a Linear Array. Users can choose between creating and using their own instance, or running a code-generated instance. 

## Note!
This implementation regards one-to-one routing, meaning that every processor will initially contain at most one packet and that each packet will have a different processor as its destination. This also implies that the number of packets cannot be greater than the number of available processors. Corresponding checks exist inside the code, and users will not be allowed to give inputs that don't meet those conditions.
